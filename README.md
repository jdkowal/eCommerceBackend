* Catch errors using `try...catch`.

* Ensure that HTTP requests respond with the correct status code.

* Use validation tools on a Sequelize model.

* Encrypt a password using `bcrypt`.

* Automate functionality using Sequelize Hooks.

* Create and run a custom method on a Sequelize instance.

* Implement and know when to use different Sequelize associations for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

* Perform subqueries using a combination of Sequelize methods and plain SQL syntax.

* Enforce code styling for an application using ESLint.

* Deploy an application with a MySQL database to Heroku.
